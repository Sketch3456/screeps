* Optimization
	- Task system
		- Instead of iterating all tasks (for) and iterating all creep (for) to count task.creeps...
		... maybe store creeps on that task in the actual target object
		... and when running the task, check to see it the creeps in that object's memory > task.creeps
		... and if so, delete the task from the stack?
		DONE:
			- adding "memory" field to tasks
			- setting "task.memory.creepname" true on giveTask
			- deleting "task.memory.creepname" on creep death
		NEEDS DOING:
			- deleting "task.memory.creepname" on creep completion of task
			- deleting "task.memory.creepname" on task completion (e.g. construction site done)
			


- CPU Profiler
	- room_cycles always equals cycles in Math.max(room_cycles, cycles)

- code in safe mode activation??	
	
- Overload Game.room?
	- room.resource(resource) return terminal + storage if has resource?
