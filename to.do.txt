- W18S41 -> XGH2O @ RCL 7!

- bug... Memory.rooms.undefined.tasks_running.undefined keeps getting set??!?

- implement safe modes...
	
- _.groupBy for runPopulations
- moveTo optimization?
	if(creep.moveTo(StartRoomFlag, {reusePath: Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER}) != OK) {
        creep.moveTo(StartRoomFlag,{reusePath:0, ignoreCreeps:true})
    }


	
** Debug/Test
	- Mineral extraction in source keeper rooms?

- Blueprints
	- Every ~500 or ~1500 ticks check if all flags (coded for structureType) are sitting on appropriate structure?
		- If not, then set construction site.
		- If at max construction sites, return;
	- Console commands to set all flags to current layout (including construction sites).
	
- Attack Optimizations
	- Towers to target flank/outside creeps, possibly creeps not near healers?
	
* Optimization
	- Task system
		... done? new ideas?

- CPU Profiler
	- room_cycles always equals cycles in Math.max(room_cycles, cycles)

- code in safe mode activation??	
	
- Overload Game.room?
	- room.resource(resource) return terminal + storage if has resource?
